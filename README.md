# General Information
* Any recent FIFA should work (That uses Frostbite Engine at least)
* Won't result in a ban as it only overrides some configs and doesn't change gamefiles
* After every FIFA-Patch the config resets which is why I made this application, instead of changing all config-files manually each time.
* Portable (No install necessary)

# Download:
Either:
* Get the build_v0.1.zip file from: https://github.com/cm45/fifaLauncherPatcher/releases
* Build it yourself using the source code

# Usage
* To start the application, extract the ZIP file and run FIFALauncherPatcher.exe
* Now select the FIFA installation folder (Something like C:\Program Files (x86)\Origin Games\FIFA19)
* Choose the options you want to have enabled:
	* Skip Game Launcher - Skips the annoying Launcher that appears before the "real" game opens
	* Skip Language Selection - Obvious I guess
	* Force Metric System - Forces the metric unit system when using the en_US localizazion
* Press Patch Game => Overrides the config files
* Start FIFA
